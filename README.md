# AlgoLab

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Algolab-CMU/Algolab.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Algolab-CMU/Algolab) (Don't worry about this for now) <br>

To start, you must
* Install mysqlclient using pip
* Install djangorestframework using pip
* Install MySQL (using the tutorial online)
* Add an account to your MySQL database with username='root' and password='root'
* Create a database caused "AlgoLab" in MySQL

## Warning

### Git
* Everyone should create their own branch named "func-user". For example, my branch is called "user-auth-hanqi". And push to that branch only. After you are done, merge the branch back to develop branch. (See: [Git-flow Tutorial](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

### Others
* It is understandable that your code might not compile as it is dependent on others' code. For example, we probably will needs Allison's base.html for every page we use. You can still commit and push under this scenario
* Every issue should be discussed on our Asana Page

Good luck!
